            | I was previously on track to become a healthcare provider, however, after some time serving as a nursing assistant I began searching for a new career that would be challenging, involved continuous learning, allowed for more flexibility than healthcare, and had ample opportunities for upward career mobility. After being inspired by my older brother who successfully transitioned from a middle school teacher to an Android developer, I began the Front End Web Development track on Treehouse. I fell in love with using my creativity, problem-solving skills, and analytical skills to program and create webpages. I enjoy the instant feedback when refreshing a web page, the plethora of tools and technologies available, and how the culture of tech prizes innovation, efficiency, and improvement. After completing the Front End Web Development track I began the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree in order to gain a deeper knowledge of JavaScript technologies. In my current position at Performance Industries I manage and maintain multiple WordPress websites for accuracy, usability, and SEO. I also manage the digital marketing efforts of the company including email marketing, search engine marketing, social media, and affiliate marketing. I'm also a coding instructor teaching Bootstrap courses for Nucamp. It's been a joy to help others start the first step towards a career in web development and to break down programming concepts for my students to digest. I wear many hats which is fitting for me since I have always been a "Jane-of-all-trades." In my free time I enjoy doing yoga, reading, traveling, writing, and outdoor activities such as hiking, boating, and kayaking.
